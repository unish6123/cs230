        There was a man who was living alone in the forest. The forest was quite
        dense as it was in the middle of amazon. One day he hears the sound of
        crying baby and decides to examine. He went near the bank of river and
        saw black object on the water. As soon as he approach the object, he saw
        the red eye with sharp teeth and rough surface on the water. He got
        frightened and decides to leave. As soon as he was turning around, the
        unidentified object dragged him inside the water. After 10 minutes he
        came out of water however, he appeared totally different. He had the red
        eye with rough skin surface and his skin color is white. Some people say
        he was possessed by some spirit. However, nobody knows what happened to
        him. Many amazon tribes beleive he is still alive and hiding somewhere
        inside the cave. Nobody goes near the water where this incident had
        happened.
